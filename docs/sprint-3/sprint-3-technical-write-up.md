## Executive Summary

Sprint 3 marked a significant stride in ensuring the reliability, expanding the foundational user management capabilities, and enhancing the maintainability of the Contextual Identity API. Key achievements included the implementation of comprehensive unit and integration tests across the backend, establishing a robust quality assurance baseline. Concurrently, a crucial user registration feature was introduced, alongside a focused redesign and **substantial refactoring of the user dashboard's UX**, aimed at enhancing intuitive identity management and improving code architecture. These efforts collectively strengthen the application's stability, functionality, and user-centric design.

## 1. Project Overview

* **Project Goal:** To create an API enabling users to manage their identity attributes and selectively share specific data sets (contexts) with different applications, enhancing user privacy.

* **Key Idea:** Provide granular control over personal data disclosure in various digital interactions.

* **Technologies:** Java (Spring Boot), React JS, MongoDB, Liquibase.

## 2. Phase 1: Quality Assurance & Core Feature Expansion

#### Objective

To ensure the reliability and functional correctness of the API and its associated services through rigorous testing, and to expand core user management capabilities by introducing a new user registration flow.

#### Key Achievements

* **Comprehensive Backend Unit and Integration Testing:**
  * Extensive **unit and integration tests were developed and implemented across the backend module**, covering a significant portion of the API's endpoints, business logic for user management, context definition, and attribute handling.
  * This effort ensured a **high level of test coverage**, providing strong validation of the API's core functionalities and data handling mechanisms. The passing of these tests established a robust baseline for the system's reliability and stability.

* **Initial Frontend Unit Testing on User Dashboard:**
  * Initial **unit testing efforts were commenced on the user dashboard frontend**, specifically targeting key components and state management logic.
  * This initial testing focused on ensuring the isolated correctness of critical frontend functionalities and data flows, contributing to the overall stability of the user interface.

* **New User Registration Feature Implementation:**
  * A **critical user registration feature was successfully implemented**, enabling new users to create accounts directly within the Contextual Identity API system.
  * This new flow incorporated necessary backend API endpoints and corresponding frontend UI components, streamlining the onboarding process for new users and making the system fully self-serve for account creation.

## 3. Phase 2: User Experience & Architecture Refinement

#### Objective

To enhance the visual appeal, clarity, and overall intuitiveness of the user dashboard, and to improve its underlying code structure for better maintainability and scalability.

#### Key Achievements

* **Redesigned and Refactored User Experience (UX) of the User Dashboard:**
  * A focused **redesign of the user dashboard's user experience (UX) was completed**, aiming to make the management of identity attributes and contexts more intuitive and visually appealing.
  * This redesign involved re-evaluating layout, navigation, and interaction patterns to streamline user workflows for defining, modifying, and viewing their contextual identity data. The enhancements were specifically targeted at improving the ease of use for managing various personal attributes and their associations with different contexts, ensuring a more cohesive and user-friendly experience.
  * Accompanying the UX improvements, a **significant refactoring effort was undertaken on the frontend user dashboard's codebase**. This involved reorganising components, optimising data flow, and improving modularity, leading to a cleaner, more maintainable, and scalable architecture for future development.
